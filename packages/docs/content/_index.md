### *What is typerpc ?*

[Typerpc](http://typerpc.run) is a schema-driven universal rpc framework written in [typescript](https://www.typescriptlang.org/). Declare your service definition in our custom typescript based dsl, then run `typerpc gen` and typerpc will generate statically typed clients and servers in as many programming languages as you define.
